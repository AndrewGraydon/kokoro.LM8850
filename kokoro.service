# We can run directly with the env python or use serve.sh.
# Using serve.sh to ensure environment variables are set if complex activation is needed, 
# but direct python call is usually cleaner for systemd if paths are absolute.
# However, the user specifically asked for serve.sh to activate the environment.
# Let's use serve.sh but ensure it works in non-interactive shell.
